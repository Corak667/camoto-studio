Outstanding tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Right-clicking to replace a file in raw format will not update the
   prefiltered (decompressed) file size.  This should either be obtained
   from the user or the new data run through the filter to obtain the
   correct size.

 ! Importing a .mid into an .imf and saving segfaults in libgamemusic
   somewhere (patch out of range maybe?)  Might only do it when updating
   events and not patches.

 - Need to notify playback thread to reapply instruments as they change,
   otherwise the changed patch won't be used until the song next changes
   to it itself.

 - Figure out where the Rockford palette is stored
