Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s.

This is Camoto Studio, the "main" part of Camoto which links everything else
together in a nice GUI.  If you are new to Camoto, this is what you want to
use.

The GUI currently supports editing these games:

 - Dangerous Dave

The GUI currently has editors for the following object types:

 - 2D Maps (overhead/platformer)
 - Tilesets

With editors for the remaining object types coming soon:

 - Images
 - Instruments (MIDI/OPL/PCM)
 - Music
 - Sound effects
 - Text

This program is released under the GPLv3 license.
